## Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment

Make the virtual environment:
```
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the venv
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Once you see this, you are in a virtual environment and you are not affecting your system wide Python installation:
```
(myenv) C:\path\to\repository>
```
